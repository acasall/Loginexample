This project combines a simple calculator and a login form to create an interactive Windows Forms application. The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate the integration of multiple forms within a C# application. The project includes the following forms:

MainForm (Calculator):
   - `btnDisplay_Click`: Accepts user input, performs addition, and displays the result.
   - `btnExit_Click`: Allows users to exit the calculator application gracefully.

Login Form:
   - `btnOk_Click`: Verifies the entered password. If correct, grants access to the calculator; otherwise, displays an error message.
